# Introduction

This project is based on [vim-scripts/Improved-AnsiEsc](https://github.com/vim-scripts/Improved-AnsiEsc).

*AnsiEsc* is a Vim plugin to show [ANSI escape code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code)
properly.

This project improves *AnsiEsc* slightly by fixing some conflicts between ANSI ESC code and Vim
syntax system, and makes it more friendly with other syntax settings.
